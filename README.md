# Project

This is the frontend for the rent sharing website for UAE residents. Under active development.

The website allows you to sign up and find properties where you can share a room or an apartment with someone else. You can check the photos, message the hosts and find the perfect place that fits your budget.

At the same time, it also allows you to advertise your own roomsharing listings. You can add descriptions, name your price, etc.

## Tech stack

Frontend is in react.js + redux-toolkit. 

The backend is not open-sourced, but it is written in Node.js + PostgreSQL and hosted on AWS in UAE.
